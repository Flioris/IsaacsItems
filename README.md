# IsaacsItems DEMO 1.16.5+
> I am not the developer of The Binding of Isaac and have nothing to do with it. I'm just a fan who brought
> a couple of fun things into Minecraft. I also want to say that I did not ask permission from the creator of The
> Binding of Isaac about whether I could use content from his game in this way, since I do not have such an opportunity
> (all his social networks are closed to me, since I am in a Sanctioned Country). If you are part of the development
> team for The Binding of Isaac and you do not approve of this use of your game content, please contact me here:

## Description
Demo version of the plugin with its resource pack, which adds items from the game The Binding of Isaac to Minecraft.
Currently, the plugin adds **possessed villagers** and the following **12 items**: The Hierophant, The Lovers, The Chariot, The Tower, Bag Lunch,
The Intruder, Rock Bottom, Socks, Monstrance, Spirit Shackles, Your Soul, It Hurts.

### Items
The plugin's items can drop from mobs with a configurable frequency, but this can also be disabled in order to issue items only with a command. At the moment, all items have the same drop chance, but in the future I plan to add a customizable chance. I would also like to say that not all items can be completely transferred from The Binding of Isaacs to Minecraft, even with the use of resource packs, so not all items have exactly the same functionality. List of items and their descriptions:
1. **The Hierophant:** Adds 2 yellow hearts. Effects are applied up to 20 yellow hearts.
2. **The Lovers:** Heals 2 hearts.
3. **The Chariot:** For 6 seconds you deal 8 contact damage.
4. **The Tower:** Spawns around 6 activated TNT. The player becomes invulnerable to explosions for a few seconds.
5. **Bag Lunch:** When you receive damage, you have a chance to receive a golden carrot.
6. **The Intruder:** When you receive damage, you have a chance to spawn a spider that will attack your enemy.
7. **Rock Bottom:** Takes all damage from effects.
8. **Socks:** Immune to fall damage.
9. **Monstrance:** Sometimes damages enemies if you hit them.
10. **Spirit Shackles:** Gives you a chance not to die in battle.
11. **Your Soul:** You can pay the possessed villager with this.
12. **It Hurts:** Fires 10 arrows when damaged.

### Entities
1. **Possessed Villagers:** They spawn at night or instead of normal villagers. Possessed villagers sell various items for souls.

## How to use
1. Install a plugin for sending resource packs or use the default resource pack system, since at the moment this plugin does not provide the ability to send resource packs to players.
2. Upload the plugin resource pack from the archive to any free hosting pack, for example, [mc-packs.net](https://mc-packs.net/).
3. Copy the SHA-1 Hash and URL, paste it into the config of your plugin for sending resource packs to players or into server.properties.
4. Install this plugin on your server and configure as necessary.
5. Enjoy!
