# IsaacsItems DEMO 1.16.5+
> I am not the developer of The Binding of Isaac and have nothing to do with it. I'm just a fan who brought
> a couple of fun things into Minecraft. I also want to say that I did not ask permission from the creator of The
> Binding of Isaac about whether I could use content from his game in this way, since I do not have such an opportunity
> (all his social networks are closed to me, since I am in a Sanctioned Country). If you are part of the development
> team for The Binding of Isaac and you do not approve of this use of your game content, please contact me here:
> fliorisdev@gmail.com
