# IsaacsItems 1.16.5+
> I am not the developer of The Binding of Isaac and have nothing to do with it. I'm just a fan who brought a couple

## Description
IsaacsItems is a plugin that comes with a resource pack, adding various artifacts from [The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/)
to Minecraft. Currently, the plugin introduces **possessed villagers** and the following **12 items**: The Hierophant,
The Lovers, The Chariot, The Tower, Bag Lunch, The Intruder, Rock Bottom, Socks, Monstrance, Spirit Shackles,
Your Soul, and It Hurts.

### Items
The plugin's items can drop from mobs with a configurable frequency, but this can also be disabled in order to issue
items only with a command. I would also like to say that not all items can be completely transferred from The Binding
of Isaacs to Minecraft, even with the use of resource packs, so not all items have exactly the same functionality.
Below is a list of items and their descriptions:
1. **The Hierophant:** Adds 2 yellow hearts. Effects are applied up to 20 yellow hearts.
2. **The Lovers:** Heals 2 hearts.
3. **The Chariot:** For 6 seconds you deal 8 contact damage.
4. **The Tower:** Spawns around 6 primed TNT. The player becomes invulnerable to explosions for a few seconds.
5. **Bag Lunch:** When you take damage, you have a chance to receive a golden carrot.
6. **The Intruder:** When you take damage, you have a chance to spawn a spider that will attack your enemy.
7. **Rock Bottom:** Takes all damage from effects.
8. **Socks:** Immune to fall damage.
9. **Monstrance:** Sometimes damages enemies if you hit them.
10. **Spirit Shackles:** Gives you a chance not to die in battle.
11. **Your Soul:** Can be used as currency for possessed villagers.
12. **It Hurts:** Fires 10 arrows when damaged.

### Entities
1. **Possessed Villagers:** They spawn at night or instead of normal villagers. Possessed villagers sell various items for souls.

## How to use 
### If the server already has its own texture pack:
1. Combine the resource pack from the IsaacsItems archive and the server resource pack;
2. Upload the resource pack to a hosting service such as mc-packs.net or host it yourself;
3. Obtain the direct download link and SHA-1 hash of the resource pack;
4. Insert the received data into the IsaacsItems config;
5. Enjoy!
